THREE OBSERVABLE TRENDS:

1. Capomulin seems to be the best performing drug of all of them since there is an actual tumor reduction observed of 19% in the mice.

2. The placebo drug performs just as efficently as Ketapril and Infubinol in terms of percent change.

3. Capomulin seems to be the best drug of choice since it has the least metastatic spread during treatment and the best survival rate during treatment.
