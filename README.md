## Background

![Laboratory](Images/Laboratory.jpg)

Welcome to Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As Chief Data Analyst, I've been granted access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. 

## Objective 

Analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this, these are the tasks completed for this project: 

  * Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
  * Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of [metastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis) (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
  * Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
  * Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
